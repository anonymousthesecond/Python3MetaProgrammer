# Python3MetaProgrammer

This tool helps you generate python code based in predefined templates and structures.Last time I tried to make something that can generate code lime chatgpt with normal human inputs in multiple languages but that went horribly wrong so here's something else not meant to be used by people who nothing about coding or programming.ANOTHER REMINDER-THIS README FILE IS WRITTEN BY AI.ONLY THE CODE IS WRITTEN BY ME.

## Installation

There's no installation required for the Code Generation Toolkit. Simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Text editor or IDE
- Terminal or command prompt

## Usage

1. **Download the Code**: Clone or download the Code Generation Toolkit repository.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

3. **Run the Example Script**: Execute the `main.py` script to see the example usage of the toolkit.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Explore and Customize**: Modify the example script or create your own Python scripts using the provided modules (`code_template.py`, `code_builder.py`, `code_generator.py`) to generate custom Python code based on your requirements.

## Example Usage

The `main.py` script demonstrates how to use the Code Generation Toolkit to dynamically generate Python code. You can customize the templates and structures to suit your needs.

## Advantages

- Dynamic code generation
- Modularity and reusability
- Customization and configuration
- Consistency across codebase
- Automation of repetitive tasks

## Limitations

- Complexity for handling advanced scenarios
- Manual input required for code templates and structures
- Limited error handling capabilities

## Conclusion

The Code Generation Toolkit provides a powerful solution for automating code generation tasks in Python projects. By leveraging predefined templates and structures, developers can streamline their development process and improve productivity.
